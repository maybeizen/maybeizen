# Hey there, I'm Izen! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my corner of GitHub! Iâ€™m a passionate software developer and aspiring full-stack engineer, constantly diving into new technologies, learning from my projects, and growing as a coder. This is where I share the code Iâ€™ve been working on, along with some of the tools and technologies that excite me most.

## A little about me:
I'm all about building things that solve problems and make life easier. Whether it's web development, automating workflows, or experimenting with new programming languages, I love the challenge of figuring out how things work. My focus is on creating intuitive and seamless user experiences through modern web apps and backend systems.

## What Iâ€™m currently learning and working on:  
- **C & C++** â€” Iâ€™m diving into low-level programming and expanding my coding knowledge.
- **Swift** â€” Iâ€™m excited to start building iOS apps and exploring the Apple ecosystem.
- **C#** â€” Iâ€™ve got my sights set on game development and applications with Unity.

## Why I code:
Coding is my way of turning ideas into reality. Whether itâ€™s creating a cool app to solve a problem or learning a new language for fun, Iâ€™m always looking to push my limits and expand my skills. I believe the best way to grow as a developer is to keep learning, building, and experimentingâ€”so that's what I do.
