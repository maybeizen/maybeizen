# Hey there, I'm maybeizen! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a backend-focused developer, a future cybersecurity badass, and a guy who believes in building stuff that just *works*.

Pull up a chair, let's get nerdy.

---

## 🌟 Who is this guy?
- 🧩 Backend lover through and through. Frontend? Miss me with that.
- 💡 Started full-stack, but backend stole my heart (and never gave it back).
- 🔐 On a mission to become a cybersecurity wizard — military? That’s the dream.
- 💖 Romance anime addict — *Tsuki ga Kirei* and *Darling in the Franxx* wrecked me in the best way.
- 🚀 My goal? Build tools people *actually* use. Make an impact. Leave a reason to be missed.
- 🌱 Currently exploring Go, Rust, and deeper system knowledge — I’m just getting started.

## 🧼 Frontend? Been There, Done That.
These tools taught me a lot, but in the end, they weren't what I enjoyed doing.

## 🧠 What are you learning?
- ⚙️ **GoLang** (My baby) — For fast, reliable, and beautiful backend systems.
- 🕵️‍♂️ **Cybersecurity** — Digging into defense, pen-testing, and all things secure.
- 💾 **Systems Thinking** — Learning the guts: memory management, compilers, and OS internals.

## 💡 Why do you code?
Because ideas deserve to exist — and I’ve got plenty.  
I build because I *love* the process. Because nothing beats turning literal pulses of electricity into something that can make someone's life so much easier.  

And honestly?  
I code to *create* — to build a future I believe in.
