# Hey there, I'm maybeizen! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my corner of GitHub! Iâ€™m a passionate software developer and aspiring full-stack engineer, constantly diving into new technologies, learning from my projects, and growing as a coder. This is where I share the code Iâ€™ve been working on, along with some of the tools and technologies that excite me the most.

## A little about me:
Iâ€™m passionate about building solutions that make life easier, whether it's through web development, automating workflows, or learning new programming languages. I focus on creating intuitive, seamless user experiences in front- and back-end systems.  

Outside of coding, I'm an anime fanâ€”*Darling in the Franxx* and *Blue Box* are some of my favorites for their emotional depth. I also dream of owning a software development business and creating tech solutions to help others. Iâ€™m always learning, growing, and chasing my goals.

## What Iâ€™m currently learning and working on:  
- **C & C++** â€” Exploring low-level programming to deepen my understanding of how computers work at a hardware level and to optimize my coding skills.  
- **GoLang** â€” Building efficient APIs and diving into concurrency, perfect for scalable and high-performance systems. Iâ€™m focusing on developing robust, multi-step software for complex applications.  
- **ReactJS & Node.js** â€” Enhancing my full-stack web development skills, building dynamic front-end interfaces and scalable back-end systems.  

## Why I code:
Coding is my way of turning ideas into reality. Whether it's creating a cool app to solve a problem or learning a new language for fun, Iâ€™m always looking to push my limits and expand my skills. I believe the best way to grow as a developer is to keep learning, building, and experimentingâ€”so that's what I do.
