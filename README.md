## 💡 Why I Code
For me, coding is about turning ideas into reality — solving problems, building cool tools, and constantly challenging myself. Every new project is a chance to learn, grow, and take one step closer to mastering my craft. Whether it's building for fun or working towards my future business, code is my creative outlet and my passion.
